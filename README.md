# Predict-students-dropout-and-academic-success-

## Problem Statement

Prediction of student’s performance became an urgent desire in most educational entities and institutes. This is essential to help at-risk students and assure their retention, providing excellent learning resources and experience, and improving university’s ranking and reputation. In this project, we are working on the student’s dataset which we have taken UCI that is one of the famous open-source repositories. The idea here is to build a classification model which can classify between three different categories of students based on the historical data of 4424 students. 

In this dataset we have a long list of features, so we need to analyze these features through different graphs and perform hypothesis testing to understand which feature is affecting the target variable. Since it’s a classification task, so we are going to apply different Machine Learning algorithms as classifiers and to evaluate the performance of each of these algorithms we are going to use different evaluation metrics such as Accuracy score, Precision score, Recall score, and F1-score etc. The result of these evaluation metrics helps us to understand how good our models are? Does it give us the accurate prediction for future data? And the analysis on this dataset which we did with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps us to make decision and recommendations for future.

## Project aim:

The aim of this project is to contribute to the reduction of academic dropout and failure in higher education, by using machine learning techniques to identify students at risk at an early stage of their academic path, so that strategies to support them can be put into place. The problem is formulated as a three-category classification task (dropout, enrolled, and graduate) at the end of the normal duration of the course.
